What if you coukd ask a machine to generate a whole TV Script for you? and then challenge your friends to guess the genre?


Of course, that is possible! 

Guess The Genre is based on powerful natural language processing and state of the art model model. All you have to do is, tell the genre you want your script to be in and Guess The Genre's model will generate that. 

Ask your friends to guess the genre. 
If they guess it right, they get one point :+1: , if they don't you get one point :+1:. 

The person with most points is crowned as the GTG Saga :crown:.


# Motivation: Why we built GTG:

Why we created what we created? 🤔

:thought_balloon: We wanted AI to work for us. GTG gives power to the players. One click and you have the script. No brainstoriming required.

:thought_balloon: Most of the AI projects are not deployed, GTG is the live example of our work in action.

:thought_balloon: It's fun to combine diverse technologies and frameworks


# Features 🔮

✔️ Sign up and Login using custom and unique ID

✔️ Share room code and invite friends over for GTG party

✔️ Challenge em'all, let's play to find our next GTG Saga :crown: 


# Genres :moyai:

We have 5 most interesting genres for you:

:cop: Superhero

:ghost: Horror

:volcano: Sci-Fi


# We started here 👇

GTG is the product developed as a part of MLH Explorer fellowship Sprint-2. It is strictly dveveloped keeping theme 'Gaming' and focus 'Clean Code' in mind.

We have follwed best software engineering practises to make sure the GTG is upto the mark. 

We saw all the teams running behind 'Unity' based projects but when simple can be extraordinary why choose complex and tedious :wink:

# Technologies Used 💻

To backup the super powerful backend we used node.js. The simple yet eye catchy frontend is based on React and CSS. The prompt text generation model  is prepared using Python and [textgenrnn model](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn). We take privacy strictly and do not store your data in any way.


# Future Scope 💡

GTG doesn't stop here, we will keep continue working on that. We hope to bring multiple features in near future but some of them are:

☀️ Support for more genres

☀️ Be the writer, take the script our model generated and complete the incomplete story

☀️ More games to make GTG a new AI gaming hub

☀️ GTG with images
